          <h3>Significance</h3>
          <h4>Historical</h4>
          <p>Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. Its four pillars are believed to symbolize the first four caliphs of Islam. There are various stories surrounding its construction, including one that it was built to mark the end of a plague, as a tribute to Allah. Another suggests it was a dedication to the Sultan's wife, Bhagmati. Some say its design resembles Shia Tazias, commemorating Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law, who was martyred at the Battle of Karbala. The French traveler Jean de Thévenot claimed that Charminar celebrates the start of the second Islamic millennium.</p>
          <p>There is also a legend about a secret tunnel connecting Charminar to Golconda Fort, although it has never been found.</p>

          <h4>UNESCO Criteria for Adaptation:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Criterion 1:</b> Masterpiece of world architecture with a unique design influencing Deccani architecture.</li>
            <li><b>Criterion 2:</b> Synthesis of Indic and Persianate cultures; inspired designs in other regions like Bukhara, Uzbekistan.</li>
            <li><b>Criterion 3:</b> Epitomizes flourishing Deccani art and architecture; protected under national and state regulations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Preservation Efforts:</h4>
          <p>Charminar has been declared a monument of national importance, with ongoing restoration efforts. Historic precincts have been established around it, and its southwestern minaret was restored using traditional stucco techniques.</p>

          <h4>Urban Context:</h4>
          <p>Despite urban encroachment, essential avenues and symbolic gateways have been preserved. Charminar remains a defining feature of Hyderabad's historical layout and retains cultural significance.</p>

        architecture: `
          <h3>Architectural Details</h3>
          <p>The Charminar is a square structure, each side measuring 20 meters (66 feet). Its arches on all four sides direct views towards the monument’s central point. Unlike the standalone minarets of the Taj Mahal, Charminar's fluted minarets are uniquely integrated into the structure. The roof features an open space that originally offered panoramic views of Hyderabad, with a mosque situated at the western end.</p>
          <p>Historically, the roof served as a royal court during the Qutb Shahi period, with the mosque on the fourth floor. Clocks were installed in 1889, facing the four cardinal directions. The central ablution facility, known as the vazu, is still present for worshippers.</p>
          <p>Charminar is also known as the Arc de Triomphe of the East and is included in UNESCO's tentative list for World Heritage status.</p>
